# Matplotlib_Challenge
Python Matplotlib appllied to a real-world situation for a fledgling ride sharing company named Pyber.

Pyber Analysis

1) Bubble Plot of Ride Sharing Data as shown in Pyber_Ride_Sharing.png located in Images folder reflects the following points
    a)Rural:
        i) Average Fare($) for Rural drivers are more than Urban and SubUrban.
        ii) Number of Drivers are less
        iii) Total number of rides are less
    b)SubUrban:
        i) Average Fare($) for SubUrban drivers are more than Urban.
        ii) Number of Drivers are less than Urban.
        iii)Total number of rides are less than Urban.
    b)Rural:
        i) Average Fare($) for Rural drivers are less than Urban and SubUrban.
        ii) Number of Drivers are more than SubUrban o.
        iii) Total number of rides are more than SubUrban.
        
2)Analysis on % of Total Fares by City Type , % of Total Rides by City Type and % of Total Drivers by City Type
        i) Urban city makes the largest income , largest  demand of rides and largest number of drivers
        ii) Since demand is less in Rural city so income generation is least in rural and number of drivers are the fewest.        
        iii) Demand is average in SubUrban city so income generation is average and number of drivers are more the Rural but less than Urban
